# Collaboration between Hassia Alzouma and Jia Guo
## Academic Research (Dr. Yijun Zhao) 
#### Problem: 
    Use BERT-large-uncased model to recover eroded words on the historical plates images
    
#### Data:
    synthetically text generated
    
#### Outcome:
    Final accuracy rate: 74.8%
    
#### Project Details:
1. Compared BERT, ALBERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa and other BERT-related NLP models on the masked language task
2. Chosen BERT-large-uncased model to predict 2,000 eroded words on the historical sites with accuracy rate as 40.2%
3. Combined the clues about the eroded words such as the identified letters with BERT to improve accuracy rate to 74.8%
